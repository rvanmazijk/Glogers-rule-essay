Exploring Gloger’s eco-geographic rule
Arjun Amar & Petra Sumasgutner
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Topic brief

Gloger’s eco-geographic rule states that animals should be darker in more humid or wetter environments (Gloger 1833). Evidence has recently been presented that it also applies to plants (Koski & Ashman, 2015). In this essay, I would like to you discuss the origin of this eco-geographic rule, the empirical support for this rule and the likely mechanisms that are proposed to explain it (e.g. Burtt & Ichida, 2004; Tate et al. 2016).

# My notes

- Gloger noted bird plumage darkness ~ warmth, humidity (Miksch; Burtt & Ichida 2004)
- Burtt & Ichida -> dark pulamge resistant to bacterial degradation (~ pgiments), a common problem in humid climes; mthods: measure intrasp. ∆colour vs bacterial activity
- cf Koski & Ashman -> UV role (in plants)
- Persistent colour polymorphism (Tate et al. 2016) within a populations of a species -> equivalent fitness of the morphs in heterogeneous habitats; results: darker species forage/hunt better in darker habitats (~ hiding in the ambient background). Since (Ruan says) darker habs are wetter (ish), this relates to Gloger's rule.
- Intrasp. Gloger's rule manifestations vs intersp./community level manifestations (Lev-Yadun 2015)
- Gloger vs anti-Gloger patterns (Lev-Yadun 2015)
- Biological/biogeographic "rules": Lomolino et al. 2006; Gaston et al. 2008 (has a def for Gloger's rule too) (also d/d's betw intrasp. traits, intersp. traits, and assemblage patterns (in community properties or community trait avgs));
