abstract = {Trichomes are known to have many functions, including protecting plants from excess sunlight, improving water economy, salt secretion, defense from herbivores, and signaling to animals. Additional anti-herbivore functions of trichomes, especially in coastal and desert habitats, are reviewed and proposed. Many sand-dune and sandy shore plants are white, whitish, or silver-colored because of white trichomes, because of sticky glandular trichomes to which sand grains and clay adhere, or because of light-colored waxes. The common explanation for this coloration is that it protects from irradiation, and that in addition, the glued sand defends them from abrasion by moving sand. This coloration was also proposed to camouflage the plants from herbivores. Similar coloration in animals that live in white, snow-covered habitats or light-colored sand or other soil substrates is commonly referred to as camouflage, and the same logic may also apply to plants. It has also been proposed that white plant surfaces undermine the camouflage of herbivorous insects that have other colors and expose them to predation. Three novel defensive mechanisms are proposed here: (1) because dust is a strong insect repellent and is lethal to insects, attached soil particles (especially clays) may defend plants with sticky glandular trichomes from insect herbivory; (2) in dicotyledonous plants that have sticky glandular trichomes, the attached sand may defend from herbivory by mammals by causing teeth wear as do phytoliths (silica bodies) of grasses; and (3) white coloration of leaves and branches may mimic fungal infestation. Direct experimental data for the functionality of these defensive mechanisms are missing for many of the old and all new hypotheses, but there are many indirect supporting indications.},

Comparing the faunulae of 21 localities from equator to the poles, the correlation coefficient r = + 0.806 (P {\textless} .001) and the regression line is described by the equation Y = 18.48 + 0.676 X. If the number of individuals--instead of species--is computed, r increases to +0.911. The increase of the proportion of dark species is also shown at higher altitudes. Literature data from the Pyrenees and the Swiss Alps were considered from ca. 1000 to 3000 m above sea level and yielded r = +0.996 and r = +0.890, and the regression lines described by Y = 39.82 + 0.0098 X and Y = 26.96 + 0.0122 X, respectively.

abstract = {Abstract We are currently experiencing a resurgence of interest in ecogeographical rules, which describe general trends in morphology and related traits along geographical gradients. In order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the generality and underlying causal mechanisms for these patterns, we recommend a new, more integrated research agenda. In particular, we recommend studies that simultaneously consider different clines in morphology, geographical ranges and diversity as intricately related phenomena; all being ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical responses of organisms to selection regimes that vary non-randomly over space and time, and among species with different ecological and evolutionary histories.},

@article{Olalla2011,
abstract = {Bergmann's rule is one of the best known empirical generalizations in biogeography and remains a topic of much interest and debate. Watt et al. claimed in 2010 that the only definition for the rule should be the one devised by Bergmann in the 19th-century. Based on direct translations from the original German manuscript, they concluded that tests of the rule should be restricted to interspecific studies of body size variation in endotherms. Furthermore, they suggested that Bergmann's heat conservation mechanism is an integral part of the rule and, hence, a simple falsificationist test of this mechanism might be enough to validate the rule. Here I advocate on a pluralistic approach to study ecogeographical rules, in general, and Bergmann's rule in particular. Our perceptions on the status and validity of laws and rules depend on the narrowness of the epistemological scope we adopt. Laws can have exceptions, do not necessarily have to be explanatory and may not be predictive. Also, we should differentiate between correlative and causal laws. Bergmann's rule is a correlative law, not a causal law, as Watt et al. implicitly assumed. It is a broad generalization with no inherent mechanism, and subject to the scrutiny of empirical investigation. Because of the ecological and evolutionary contingencies there will hardly be any law in ecology that is universally true. We have to consider each of these contingencies and study Bergmann's rule in a diversity of systems, organisms and levels of biological organization to gain further insight into the processes underlying the geographic variation in body size. On the basis of the empirical evidence to date, we cannot entirely dismiss a thermoregulatory mechanism to explain body size clines in both ectotherms and endotherms and support a food availability mechanism instead, as Watt et al. suggested. Even so, a unifying explanation for Bergmann's rule still remains elusive. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

abstract = {Gloger's rule posits that darker birds are found more often in humid environments than in arid ones, especially in the tropics. Accordingly, desert-inhabiting animals tend to be light-colored. This rule is also true for certain mammalian groups, including humans. Gloger's rule is manifested at 2 levels: (1) at the species level (different populations of the same species have different pigmentation at different latitudes), and (2) at the species assembly level (different taxa at a certain geography have different pigmentation than other taxa found at different habitats or latitudes). Concerning plants, Gloger's rule was first proposed to operate in many plant species growing in sand dunes, sandy shores and in deserts, because of being white, whitish, or silver colored, based on white trichomes, because of sand grains and clay particles glued to sticky glandular trichomes, or because of light-colored waxes. Recently, Gloger's rule was shown to also be true at the intraspecific level in relation to protection of anthers from UV irradiation. While Gloger's rule is true in certain plant taxa and ecologies, there are others where “anti-Gloger” coloration patterns exist. In some of these the selective agents are known and in others they are not. I present both Gloger and “anti-Gloger” cases and argue that this largely neglected aspect of plant biology deserves much more research attention},

abstract = {Ecogeographic rules explain spatial trends in biodiversity, species interactions and phenotypes1. Gloger's rule and its corollaries state that pigmentation of endothermic animals will increase from more polar to equatorial regions due to changing selective pressures including heat, humidity, predation and UV irradiance2,​3,​4. In plants, floral pigmentation varies within and among taxa, yet causes of wide-scale geographic variation are lacking. We show that Gloger's rule explains patterns of variation in UV-absorbing floral pigmentation in a widespread plant, Argentina anserina (Rosaceae). Specifically, the floral pigmentation pattern unique to the UV spectrum (UV ‘bullseye') increases with proximity to the Equator in both hemispheres, and larger bullseyes are associated with higher UVB incidence. Experiments confirm UV as an agent of selection and bullseye size as a target. Results extend the generality of an ecogeographic rule—formulated for animals—to plants, implicating UV as a selective agent on a floral trait generally assumed to enhance plant–pollinator interactions. Global change is expected to alter UV irradiance in terrestrial systems5, potentially intensifying the importance of UV-mediated selection to floral evolution. Because floral UV reflectance and pattern enhance pollinator attraction6,7, altered selective regimes could disrupt coevolved plant–pollinator interactions, weakening an important ecosystem service8.},

abstract = {Abstract Coat color variation due to melanin pigment synthesis in house mice Mus musculus in Asia is described and found to be consistent with Gloger's rule, which states that individuals of endothermic animals are darker in humid habitats than those in drier habitats. Three properties of coat color (hue, value and chroma) were measured, and a lightness variable was derived from a principal components analysis using 428 skin specimens representing three subspecies from 85 localities. Dorsal coat color ranged from yellow through brown to black, whereas ventral coat color ranged from white to black. Dorsal coat color varied less than the ventral color. In our samples, the variation in coat color in natural populations was far less than that observed in the laboratory. We found a significant correlation between the lightness variable of dorsal coat color and precipitation. Dark coat color was observed in more humid and closed habitats (darker background color), and pale coat color in drier, more open habitats (lighter background color). This result might imply the role of concealment as a selective force affecting dorsal coat color that was observed in house mice. We also discussed other selective forces that could affect the coat color variation in house mice, such as resistance to bacterial degradation and thermoregulation. In addition, the color spectra of the dorsal pelage among the three subspecies were different, the major distinction being the environmental background color of the habitats in which they are distributed.},

Changes in size, vulnerability, reproductive status, habitat and metabolism are often associated with ontogenetic colour change and can aid in understanding its adaptive significance. Neutral or non-adaptive ontogenetic colour changes due to phylogenetic inertia and developmental constraints are also considered. Existing studies of ontogenetic colour changes in marine invertebrates, terrestrial invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals are discussed within this framework.

Cultured haptophytes have played a relevant role in advances in this analytical field and many pigments described in the literature were first detected in members of this algal group. The present chapter provides an historical overview of pigment detection in the Haptophyta and contains new data on their distribution in cultured coccolithophores (some of which not previously cultured), analysed in the context of the EC funded CODENET project. This comparative HPLC study was con- ducted with the largest (73 monoclonal strains) and most diverse (36 species rep- resenting ten families and four orders, including six holococcolithophores) hapto- phyte sample set ever subjected to a comparative study. The observed extra- ordinary diversity in the pigment composition (based on ten carotenoids, five po- lar- and three non-polar chlorophyll types) appeared closely related to current tax- onomy and published phylogeny. Chl a and the accessory pigments MgDVP, Chl c2 , Ddx, Dtx and $\beta$,$\beta$-carotene comprised the common haptophyte pigment load. Based on ecological preferences, all species synthesised either Chl c1 (littoral, benthic or brackish waters) or HFx (open-ocean and non-littoral coastal environ- ments). HFx thus recovered its previously questioned status as a straightforward marker for haptophyte distribution in offshore habitats. Haploid and diploid life- cycle stages (analysed separately for the first time in both Coccolithus and Emili- ania) yielded identical pigment compositions. This provided further evidence for an evolutionary origin of pigment content, rather than short-term temporal adaptations to environmental conditions.},

In the present study, we examined selective strength on flower diameter, flower height, UV bulls-eye size, sepal size and UV proportion via female fitness in Caltha scaposa, based on open-pollinated and hand-pollinated flowers, through which pollinator-mediated selection was calculated for each of floral traits. Our results suggest that seed production of C. scaposa is pollen limited in natural conditions. There was directional selection ($\Delta$$\beta$pollinator = −0.12) for larger flowers in open-pollinated flowers, while no significant selection was found in flower height, UV bulls-eye size, sepal size or UV proportion. Statistically significant selection was found in UV bulls-eye size, sepal size and UV proportion in hand-pollinated flowers, but interactions with pollinators contributed only to flower diameter. We conclude that in C. scaposa, floral traits that are subjected to selection might be driven by multiple selective agents, and suggest the importance of investigating floral traits that are invisible to human but visible to pollinators in measuring pollinator-mediated selection via male fitness.},

abstract = {Animals often exhibit predictable geographic variation in morphology, and such ecogeographic patterns reflect local adaptation to varying environmental conditions. The most common of these patterns are termed Bergmann's, Allen's, and Gloger's rules. I studied morphological variation in the Hawaii Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis) and the Oahu Elepaio (C. ibidis), forest birds endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. I measured body size and plumage color of 223 live elepaios captured at 36 sites on Hawaii and 132 live elepaios captured at 23 sites on Oahu, and I examined 132 museum specimens from an additional 22 locations on Hawaii. I used multiple regressions to examine relationships of elepaio body size and plumage color to elevation and annual rainfall on each island. Size of Hawaii Elepaios varied among sites and was related to elevation and rainfall. Wing chord, tail length, and body mass had positive relationships with elevation, as predicted by Bergmann's rule. Proportional bill length and proportional tarsus length were inversely related to elevation, as predicted by Allen's rule. In Hawaii Elepaios, 17 of 20 plumage color variables were related to rainfall. Elepaios in wetter areas were more heavily pigmented and had fewer and smaller white markings, as predicted by Gloger's rule. Plumage color of Oahu Elepaios showed similar but weaker patterns and only two of 20 plumage characters were related to rainfall. All body-size and plumage-color measurements had smoothly clinal distributions, with no large gaps with respect to elevation or rainfall. Putative subspecies of the Hawaii Elepaio differed in mean value of several plumage characters, but there was overlap in plumage color among subspecies and variation within them, and none of the three subspecies was diagnosable from both other subspecies by any plumage character using the 75{\%} rule. Elepaios differed morphologically among sites only a few kilometers apart because of their sedentary behavior and the steep gradients in temperature and elevation and limited climatic variation of the tropical environment of the Hawaiian Islands. Morphological variation in elepaios is smoothly clinal because there are few dispersal barriers and elepaios inhabit areas with a range of climates and vegetation. Although my results did not support the designation of subspecies within the Hawaii Elepaio, morphological and underlying genetic variation is important, and conservation of elepaios with varying phenotypes would preserve evolutionary potential and ability to adapt to climate change.},

abstract = {Patterns of ecotypic variation constitute some of the few 'rules' known to modern biology. Here, we examine several well-known ecogeographical rules, especially those pertaining to body size in contemporary, historical and fossil taxa. We review the evidence showing that rules of geographical variation in response to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological changes through time in response to climate change. These rules hold at various time scales, ranging from contemporary to geological time scales. Patterns of body size variation in response to climate change at the individual species level may also be detected at the community level. The patterns underlying ecotypic variation are complex and highly context-dependent, reducing the 'predictive-power' of ecogeographical rules. This is especially true when considering the increasing impact of human activities on the environment. Nonetheless, ecogeographical rules may help interpret the likely influences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems. Global climate change has already influenced the body size of several contemporary species, and will likely have an even greater impact on animal communities in the future. For this reason, we highlight and emphasise the importance of museum specimens and the continued need for documenting the earth's biological diversity.},

abstract = {Climate warming leads to a decrease in biodiversity. Organisms can deal with the new prevailing environmental conditions by one of two main routes, namely evolving new genetic adaptations or through phenotypic plasticity to modify behaviour and physiology. Melanin-based colouration has important functions in animals including a role in camouflage and thermoregulation, protection against UV-radiation and pathogens and, furthermore, genes involved in melanogenesis can pleiotropically regulate behaviour and physiology. In this article, I review the current evidence that differently coloured individuals are differentially sensitive to climate change. Predicting which of dark or pale colour variants (or morphs) will be more penalized by climate change will depend on the adaptive function of melanism in each species as well as how the degree of colouration covaries with behaviour and physiology. For instance, because climate change leads to a rise in temperature and UV-radiation and dark colouration plays a role in UV-protection, dark individuals may be less affected from global warming, if this phenomenon implies more solar radiation particularly in habitats of pale individuals. In contrast, as desertification increases, pale colouration may expand in those regions, whereas dark colourations may expand in regions where humidity is predicted to increase. Dark colouration may be also indirectly selected by climate warming because genes involved in the production of melanin pigments confer resistance to a number of stressful factors including those associated with climate warming. Furthermore, darker melanic individuals are commonly more aggressive than paler conspecifics, and hence they may better cope with competitive interactions due to invading species that expand their range in northern latitudes and at higher altitudes. To conclude, melanin may be a major component involved in adaptation to climate warming, and hence in animal populations melanin-based colouration is likely to change as an evolutionary or plastic response to climate warming.},

abstract = {We summarize direct and indirect effects on fitness components of animal color pattern and present a synthesis of theories concerning the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of chromatic multiple niche polymorphisms. Previous endeavors have aimed primarily at identifying conditions that promote the evolution and maintenance of polymorphisms. We consider in a conceptual model also the reciprocal influence of color polymorphism on population processes and propose that polymorphism entails selective advantages that may promote the ecological success of polymorphic species. The model begins with an evolutionary branching event from mono- to polymorphic condition that, under the influence of correlational selection, is predicted to promote the evolution of physical integration of coloration and other traits (cf. multi-trait coevolution and complex phenotypes). We propose that the coexistence within a population of alternative ecomorphs with coadapted gene complexes promotes utilization of diverse environmental resources, population stability and persistence, colonization success, and range expansions, and enhances the evolutionary potential and speciation. Conversely, we predict polymorphic populations to be less vulnerable to environmental change and at lower risk of range contractions and extinctions compared with monomorphic populations. We offer brief suggestions as to how these falsifiable predictions may be tested.},

abstract = {Selection driven by biotic interactions can generate variation in floral traits. Abiotic selection, however, also contributes to floral diversity, especially with respect to patterns of pigmentation. Combining comparative studies of floral pigmentation and geography can reveal the bioclimatic factors that may drive macroevolutionary patterns of floral color. We create a molecular phylogeny and measure ultraviolet (UV) floral pattern for 177 species in the Potentilleae tribe (Rosaceae). Species are similar in flower shape and visible color but vary in UV floral pattern. We use comparative approaches to determine whether UV pigmentation variation is associated with geography and/or bioclimatic features (UV-B, precipitation, temperature). Floral UV pattern was present in half of the species, while others were uniformly UV-absorbing. Phylogenetic signal was detected for presence/absence of pattern, but among patterned species, quantitative variation in UV-absorbing area was evolutionarily labile. Uniformly UV-absorbing species tended to experience higher UV-B irradiance. Patterned species occurring at higher altitudes had larger UV-absorbing petal areas, corresponding with low temperature and high UV exposure. This analysis expands our understanding of the covariation of UV-B irradiance and UV floral pigmentation from within species to that among species, and supports the view that abiotic selection is associated with floral diversification among species.},

abstract = {Aim In 1833, C.L. Gloger observed that bird populations living in warm and wet habitats were darker than those found in dry, cool areas. However, this hypothesis has seldom been evaluated, particularly for mammals. Here, we test Gloger's rule using a dataset consisting of more than 100 primate species representing all major primate clades. Location Africa, Madagascar, Asia and the Neotropics. Methods We used museum skins, digital photography, and colour correction software to quantify the brightness of the dorsal and ventral pelage surface of each species. We utilized the mean actual evapotranspiration (AET) within the geographic range of each species as a proxy for habitat conditions and accounted for additional variables that may influence coloration. To analyse the data, we used a generalized linear model that simultaneously accounts for the effects of phylogenetic and spatial autocorrelation. Results We found that increasing levels of AET were significantly related to increasing pelage darkness on the dorsal surface of species, while accounting for other effects. Main conclusions Our finding provides further support for the applicability of Gloger's rule to mammals, and is the first broad-scale evaluation for primates. The mechanism driving Gloger's rule is not easy to discern, but may include increased background matching for species living in relatively light or dark habitats, increased resistance to keratin-degrading micro-organisms in hair with large amounts of eumelanin, and/or thermoregulation},

Collectively, their diet was diverse, with each species relying on fruits and leaves to different extents. The mean chromaticity of both foods, as perceived by the green-red and yellow-blue signals that catarrhines decode, was distinct from background foliage. However, selection on the basis of color was evident only for leaves. Primates consumed leaves with higher green-red values than the leaves they avoided-sensory mechanism that correlated with key nutritional variables, such as increased protein and reduced toughness. Moreover, the monkeys ingested leaves near dusk, when reddish targets may be more salient. Similar patterns were never observed with respect to edible fruits, the chromaticities of which did not differ from unconsumed fruits or correlate with nutritional properties. We also found that primate biomass is higher in seasonal sites. We conclude that these findings are consistent with the notion that routine trichromatic vision evolved in a context where seasonal folivory was pivotal to survival.},

Researchers have long proposed that social behaviours have shaped the evolution of primate facial diversity. However, the primate face constitutes a unique structure where the diverse and potentially competing functions of communication, ecology and physiology intersect, and the major determinants of facial diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we provide the first evidence for an adaptive role of facial colour patterns and pigmentation within Neotropical primates. Consistent with the hypothesis that facial patterns function in communication and species recognition, we find that species living in smaller groups and in sympatry with a higher number of congener species have evolved more complex patterns of facial colour. The evolution of facial pigmentation and hair length is linked to ecological factors, and ecogeographical rules related to UV radiation and thermoregulation are met by some facial regions. Our results demonstrate the interaction of behavioural and ecological factors in shaping one of the most outstanding facial diversities of any mammalian lineage.},

We found support for the role of breeding season light level in explaining the clinal pattern of variation in morph ratio across the species range throughout South Africa.

abstract = {In this paper I argue that the general concordance among species of birds in their clinal (gradual) patterns of geographic variation in size and color of plumage is so high that the primary regulatory process must be physiological adaptation to climate or its correlates. Size variation in the American Robin, a widespread species that shows the pattern of clinal variation typical in North American passerines, can be well predicted by measures of summer climate that include the effects of both temperature and humidity. July mean noon absolute humidity is a good predictor of size variation in the robin within the United States. Geographic variation in the color of the plumage of the robin, which involves interactions among several pigments, is independent of its size variation but in accord with color variation in other species. Both Bergmann's and Gloger's ecogeographic rules are important empirical models for which the physiological basis needs further study. To establish that functional differences are subject to natural selection requires showing that geographic differences have a genetic basis and that these differences are related to the survival and reproduction of individuals at different localities. Laboratory and field experiments with Red-winged Blackbirds show that environmentally induced effects on development probably contribute to clines in measurements of adults in this species. Further work is needed to clarify the generality of the relationship between clinal variation and environmentally induced variation and to determine the functional significance of clines and their relationship to survival and reproduction in different localities. Environmental plasticity itself is geographically variable. It may have a genetic basis and be an object of selection.},

Gloger's rule posits that animals should be dark- vs. light-colored in warm and humid vs. cold and dry habitats, respectively. The rule is based on the assumption that melanin pigments and/or dark coloration confer selective advantages in warm and humid regions. This rule may not apply, however, if genes for color are acting on other traits conferring fitness benefits in specific climes. Covariation between coloration and climate will therefore depend on the relative importance of coloration or melanin pigments and the genetically correlated physiological and behavioral processes that enable an animal to deal with climatic factors.

abstract = {The development of a more synthetic approach to understanding spatial patterns in biogeography, particularly of the way in which these patterns interact, constitutes a major challenge for the field. Here we propose some key elements of such a synthesis for what can broadly be termed 'ecogeographical rules', that is spatial patterns in biological traits. These include understanding: (1) the different kinds of patterns (intraspecific, interspecific and assemblage), and the distinctions between them; (2) the unifying role that geographical ranges play in linking the patterns together; (3) that this unification can be obscured by the methodological assumptions made in documenting some patterns (e.g. assuming that intraspecific variation does not significantly influence interspecific and assemblage patterns in traits); (4) the implications of other methodological issues for the nature of observed patterns (e.g. how ranges are located on positional or environmental axes for interspecific patterns); (5) the need for further development of models linking different types of traits; (6) the nature of the generality of documented patterns at all levels, and particularly the difference between the frequency with which patterns are documented in the literature and the variety of extant species; and (7) the constraints that the form of intraspecific patterns place on interspecific and assemblage patterns, and that interspecific patterns place on assemblage patterns.},

abstract = {The disjunct distribution of plants between eastern Asia (EA) and North America (NA) is one of the most well-known biogeographic patterns. However, the formation and historical process of this pattern have been long debated. Chamaecyparis is a good model to test previous hypotheses about the formation of this disjunct pattern as it contains six species disjunctly distributed in EA, western North America (WNA) and eastern North America (ENA). In this study, we applied ecological niche models to test the formation of the disjunct pattern of Chamaecyparis. The model calibrated with the EA species was able to predict the distribution of eastern NA species well, but not the western NA species. Furthermore, the eastern Asian species were shown to have higher niche overlap with the eastern North American species. The EA species were also shown to share more similar habitats with ENA species than with WNA species in the genus. Chamaecyparis species in WNA experienced a significant niche shift compared with congeneric species. Chamaecyparis had a low number of suitable regions in Europe and the middle and western NA during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period, and became extinct in the former region whereas it retains residual distribution in the latter. The extirpations in western NA and Europe in response to the late Neogene and Quaternary climatic cooling and the more similar habitats between ENA and EA ultimately shaped the current intercontinental disjunct distribution of Chamaecyparis. Both current hypotheses may be also jointly applied to explain more eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunctions observed today.},
