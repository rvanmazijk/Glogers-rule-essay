Table: Summary of patterns in organismal darkness (for three different practical groups: Endotherms, ectotherms, and plants) across geographical humidity gradients for comparisons at three different scales of biological organisation (Scales): within species, between species, and between communities. See text for more details. The symbols in each cell denote the applicability and/or state of knowledge of Gloger's rule for that cell's scale and organismal group. +, Gloger's rule observed; -, inverse Gloger's rule observed; +/-, Gloger's rule observed partially, with opposite patterns in certain cases; ?, unstudied.
