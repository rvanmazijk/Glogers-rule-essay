Table: Summary of patterns in organismal darkness (for three different practical groups: Endotherms, ectotherms, and plants) across geographical humidity gradients for comparisons at three different scales of biological organisation (Scale): within species, between species, and between communities. See text for more details. The symbols in each cell denote the applicability and/or state of knowledge of Gloger's rule for that scale and organismal group, as follows: $+$, Gloger's rule observed; $-$, inverse Gloger's rule observed; $\pm$, Gloger's rule observed partially, with opposite patterns in certain cases; $?$, unstudied.
