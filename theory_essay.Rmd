# Topic brief

- Gloger’s eco-geographic rule states that animals should be darker in more humid or wetter environments (Gloger 1833). Evidence has recently been presented that it also applies to plants (Koski & Ashman, 2015). In this essay, I would like to you discuss the origin of this eco-geographic rule, the empirical support for this rule and the likely mechanisms that are proposed to explain it (e.g. Burtt & Ichida, 2004; Tate et al. 2016).

<!--First ya tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em,-->

Gloger's rule is an ecogeographic trend wherein organisms possess darker pigmentation in warmer, more humid environments [@Gloger1833; @Bishop2016; @LevYadun2015]. @Gloger1833 first described this pattern in birds, and consequently the rule is largely treated as applying to endothermic animals [@Bishop2016<!--more refs here?-->]. However, evidence mounts for the pattern's applicability to ectotherms [e.g. @Rapoport1969; @Bishop2016], and plants [e.g. @LevYadun2007; @Koski2015]. Though, there may be different processes in different taxa that result in this pattern of organismal pigmentation across climatic gradients.

Herein, I discuss the treatment of ecogeographic rules in ecological and evolutionary science, and within this context discuss the degree to which Gloger's rule has merit as a genuine pattern in nature. I discuss insights into possible mechanisms that generate the Gloger's rule pattern, and how these vary between taxa, and across levels of biological organisation. I argue that there is sufficient<!--/insufficient--> evidence to support Gloger's rule as a useful and true generalisation.


<!--Then ya tell 'em,-->

## Ecogeographic & biogeographic "rules"

### Theory vs empiricism of "rules" ...

@Lomolino2006 outline the study of observed patterns or trends of organismal traits across geographical space. These ecogeographic "rules" (i.e. observations<!--elaborate on the nature of "rules"-->) highlight examples of pattern at broad ecological scales as consequence of processes at a range of scales. Indeed, the patterns themselves are also manifest at a variety of scales<!--(namely ontogenetic, intraspecific, interspecific, and assemblage)-->. As such, @Lomolino2006 says, underlying causal mechanisms behind these patterns are difficult to ascertain.

@Lomolino2006 also talk about theory vs empirical evidence, and varying scales, and also the evolutionary side to *eco*geographic rules.

@Gaston2008 (has a def for Gloger's rule too) (also d/d's betw intrasp. traits, intersp. traits, and assemblage patterns (e.g. Bishop2016 on ants) (in community properties or community trait avgs))

@Millien2006 discuss ecotypic (i.e. intraspecific, i.e. between populations) variation in terms of ecogeographic rules, too.

@Olalla2011 discusses approaches to studying rules too, with focus on Bergmann's rule<!--ref?-->. @Olalla2011 advocates a *pluralist* approach, wherein the manifestations of ecogeographical rules at multiple scales and levels of biological organisation are considered. He also outlines that "laws" and "rules" in ecology, and in science generally, need not *always* contain mechanistic statements, need not be without exception, as they are "correlative generalisations". Though, mechanistic understandings of the processes that generate these law-defining patterns is desirable, and indeed often the aim of research, this does not imply that correlative ecogeographic rules are not useful intrinsically. Not least, these rules are often the starting point of research. Thus, these rules represent interesting observed patterns that can motivate research, *and* useful generalisations that can be employed in other work.

### Ecogeographic rules across levels of organisation

+ stuff above

Ontogenetic level too! (Booth, C.L. 1990)


## Gloger's rule---evidence & examples

### Origins of the rule

See @Roulin2015 for a good def of the rule in the abstract (e.g. fitness benefits of melanin in warma and environments). @Roulin2015 also compare this to fitness in warm/humid climes is conferred via alternative phenotypic adaptations (owls) (see their results---*it's complicated*)

### Manifestations of Gloger's rules

Intrasp. Gloger's rule manifestations (= "ecotypic", sensu @Millien2006) svs intersp./community level manifestations (Lev-Yadun 2015)

### Where does this idea come from? What's the logic?

- Gloger's observations
    - Gloger noted bird plumage darkness ~ warmth, humidity (Miksch; Burtt & Ichida 2004)
- His contemporaries' thoughts
- Theoretical reasoning behind the rule (if any??)

### Evidence & examples

<!--Is the rule founded in empirical observation? How ubiquitous is it?-->

Gloger vs anti-Gloger patterns [sensu @LevYadun2015], e.g "negative Gloger's rule" in invertebrates, e.g. Collembolates [@Rapoport1969]

Does the pattern exist? Is it observed in the first place? Dissect the observations at the intrasp., intersp., and assemblage levels

@Kamilar2011 primate *inter*specific coat colour follows Gloger's rule -> little mechanistic work in this paper though! They speculate about 1) background matching, 2) anti-bacterial stuff, and 3) maybe thermoregulation (#FutureStudies). Unlikely to be UV, because primates live in trees! (not even in the upper-canopy, where UV is strong---primates do not spend tonnes of time up there)

@Vanderwerf2012 looked at bird body size, bill size, and plumage in populations two closesly related birds across environmental gradients in Hawai'i. With regards to plumage, bird individuals (N.B. this is basically intraspecific-scale work!), Gloger's rule was supported, and with "smoothly clinal distributions" [sic] (as a function of thew few dispersal barries *and* steep environmental gradients.

@Bishop2016 ant *assemblage* work (ECTOTHERMAL):

- organismal darkenss as a modal patter
- at low temperatures for thermoregulatory need
- at higher temperatures for UV-B protectio
- also darkness incr with smaller body siz
- these patterns are evident at the *assemblage* level

```

Plants vs endothermic animals vs ectothermic animals; UV-B protection (Gloger's rule) vs thermal hypothesis vs dessication hypothesis [@Pinkert2016]; Plants foliarly [sensu @LevYadun2007] vs florally [sensu @Koski2015]

Animal vs plant e.g. -> differences in meaning and interpretation. Also consider @Dominy2004 food colour and primates---could THIS connect to an environmental pattern in plant colour?


## Mechanisms behind the pattern

<!--What could be causing this pattern, and why? Does it depend on the organism?-->

@burtt2004 found that dark pluamge is resistant to bacterial degradation (~ pigments), a common problem in humid climes; methods: measure intrasp. ∆colour vs bacterial activity.

cf Koski & Ashman (2015) -> UV role (in plants)

@tate2016 found persistent colour polymorphism within a populations of a species -> equivalent fitness of the morphs in heterogeneous habitats; results: darker species forage/hunt better in darker habitats (~ hiding in the ambient background). Since (Ruan says) darker habs are wetter (ish), this relates to Gloger's rule.

- Connect evidence above to mechanisms described in their respective papers (if applicable)
- & mechanisms from other papers concerning pigment and environment (e.g. Tate et al. 2016)
- Dissect the observations at the intrasp., intersp., and assemblage levels MECHANISTICALLY
- Animal vs plant e.g. -> differences in meaning and interpretation for MECHANISM


## Concluding remarks

<!--And then ya tell 'em what ya told 'em-->

- ...

@Millien2006 traits vary with geography, but also with global cliamte change!
