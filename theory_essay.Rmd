- Eco-geographic and biogeographic rules
- Theory vs empiricism of "rules"
- Gloger's rule
- Manifestations of Gloger's rules
- Some intro stuff
- "Herein, I argue that there is <!--in-->sufficient evidence to support Gloger's rule as a useful and true generalisation [...]"

<!--Then ya tell 'em,-->


# Origins of the rule

<!--Where does this idea come from? What's the logic?-->
- Gloger's observations
- His contemporaries' thoughts
- Theoretical reasoning behind the rule


# Evidence & examples

<!--Is the rule founded in empirical observation? How ubiquitous is it?-->
- ...
- Does the pattern exist? Is it observed in the first place?
- Dissect the observations at the intrasp., intersp., and assemblage levels
- Animal vs plant e.g. -> differences in meaning and interpretation


# Mechanisms behind the pattern

<!--What could be causing this pattern, and why? Does it depend on the organism?-->
- ...
- Connect evidence above to mechanisms described in their respective papers (if applicable)
- & mechanisms from other papers concerning pigment and environment (e.g. Tate et al. 2016)
- Dissect the observations at the intrasp., intersp., and assemblage levels MECHANISTICALLY
- Animal vs plant e.g. -> differences in meaning and interpretation for MECHANISM


# Concluding remarks

<!--And then ya ell 'em what ya told 'em-->
