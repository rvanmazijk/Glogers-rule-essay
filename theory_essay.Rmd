# Topic brief

- Gloger’s eco-geographic rule states that animals should be darker in more humid or wetter environments (Gloger 1833). Evidence has recently been presented that it also applies to plants (Koski & Ashman, 2015). In this essay, I would like to you discuss the origin of this eco-geographic rule, the empirical support for this rule and the likely mechanisms that are proposed to explain it (e.g. Burtt & Ichida, 2004; Tate et al. 2016).

## Ecogeographic and biogeographic "rules"

@Lomolino2006 outline the study of observed patterns or trends of organismal traits across geographical space. These ecogeographic "rules" (i.e. observations<!--elaborate on the nature of "rules"-->) highlight examples of pattern at broad ecological scales as consequence of processes at a range of scales. Indeed, the patterns themselves are also manifest at a variety of scales

@Gaston2008 (has a def for Gloger's rule too) (also d/d's betw intrasp. traits, intersp. traits, and assemblage patterns (e.g. Bishop2016 on ants) (in community properties or community trait avgs))


Ontogenetic level too! (Booth, C.L. 1990)

- Theory vs empiricism of "rules"
- Gloger's rule
- Manifestations of Gloger's rules
    - Intrasp. Gloger's rule manifestations vs intersp./community level manifestations (Lev-Yadun 2015)
- Some intro stuff
- "Herein, I argue that there is sufficient<!--/insufficient--> evidence to support Gloger's rule as a useful and true generalisation [...]"


<!--Then ya tell 'em,-->

# Origins of the rule

<!--Where does this idea come from? What's the logic?-->
- Gloger's observations
    - Gloger noted bird plumage darkness ~ warmth, humidity (Miksch; Burtt & Ichida 2004)
- His contemporaries' thoughts
- Theoretical reasoning behind the rule


# Evidence & examples

<!--Is the rule founded in empirical observation? How ubiquitous is it?-->
- ...
- Gloger vs anti-Gloger patterns (Lev-Yadun 2015)
- Does the pattern exist? Is it observed in the first place?
- Dissect the observations at the intrasp., intersp., and assemblage levels
- @Kamilar2011 primate *inter*specific coat colour follows Gloger's rule -> little mechanistic work in this paper though! They speculate about 1) background matching, 2) anti-bacterial stuff, and 3) maybe thermoregulation (#FutureStudies)
    - unlikely to be UV, because primates live in trees!
        - (not even in the upper-canopy, where UV is strong---primates do not spend tonnes of time up there)
- @Bishop2016 ant *assemblage* work (ECTOTHERMAL):
    - organismal darkenss as a modal pattern
    - at low temperatures for thermoregulatory needs
    - at higher temperatures for UV-B protection
    - also darkness incr with smaller body size
    - these patterns are evident at the *assemblage* level

- Animal vs plant e.g. -> differences in meaning and interpretation
    - @Dominy2004 food colour and primates?
        - could THIS connect to an environmental pattern in plant colour?


# Mechanisms behind the pattern

<!--What could be causing this pattern, and why? Does it depend on the organism?-->
- ...
- Burtt & Ichida -> dark pulamge resistant to bacterial degradation (~ pigments), a common problem in humid climes; mthods: measure intrasp. ∆colour vs bacterial activity
    - cf Koski & Ashman -> UV role (in plants)
- Persistent colour polymorphism (Tate et al. 2016) within a populations of a species -> equivalent fitness of the morphs in heterogeneous habitats; results: darker species forage/hunt better in darker habitats (~ hiding in the ambient background). Since (Ruan says) darker habs are wetter (ish), this relates to Gloger's rule.
- Connect evidence above to mechanisms described in their respective papers (if applicable)
- & mechanisms from other papers concerning pigment and environment (e.g. Tate et al. 2016)
- Dissect the observations at the intrasp., intersp., and assemblage levels MECHANISTICALLY
- Animal vs plant e.g. -> differences in meaning and interpretation for MECHANISM
